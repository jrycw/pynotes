# Scope
`PyNotes` is aimed to collect some interesting topics I learned while learning Python. 

Each `PyNote` contains 4 parts:

* Origin : A general problem is given to ask you to think about how to resolve it. 
* Exercise : A contrived exercise is provided to challenge whether your idea works or not.
* Hands-On : After you resolve the given exercise, you can come back to this section to check out how I tackle down the exercise via various approaches. Meanwhile, I will try to explain what the potential issue(s) each approach might have. Finally, you can always find my preferred approach named as "My approach" in the last part of this section.
* Summary : Some important takeaways of each `PyNote` will be highlighted here.

My goal is to make each`PyNote` easy to digest within 15 mins. 

I hope you will be benefited from each`PyNote` and be able to use what you learned for your awesome Python project.

Feedback is welcome. You can find my contacts below via social icons.

Before diving into `PyNotes`, I would suggest you take a few minutes to read `The Zen of Python` (just type `import this` in Python).

Everytime I read it, I learn something and appreciate more the beauty of Python.

Good luck and happy coding in Python!

    ```
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
